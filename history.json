This system allows users to lock their BRC-20 tokens for a specified period to earn rewards.\n\n1. Create a BRC-Stake deploy document which includes the following fields:\n- Ticker (BRC-20 token)\n- Stake reward rate\n- Eligibility duration\n- Withdrawal window\n\n2. Users can stake any amount of BRC-20 tokens with a dedicated JSON inscription containing:\n- Ticker\n- Amount\n- Start timestamp\n- End timestamp\n- Lock duration\n- Withdrawal grace period\n\n3. Once the stake begins, the staking balance is transferred to an \"in-stake\" state, separate from the user's normal balance. To ensure security, a dedicated taproot address for staking is recommended.\n\n4. When the lock duration ends, the user becomes eligible for rewards and can claim tokens within the withdrawal window. Create a JSON inscription for rewards, containing the ticker, user's stake address, and reward amount.\n\n5. To withdraw staked tokens and claim rewards, users create a JSON inscription:\n- Ticker\n- Stake address\n- Withdrawal address\n- Requested staked & rewards balance\n\n6. Integrate this staking system with BRC-20 marketplaces and wallet platforms to simplify the process. Ensure users track, stake, and withdraw tokens seamlessly.\n\nBRC-Stake gives BRC-20 holders another way to maximize their assets, innovate within the Ordinal Theory, and expand the Bitcoin ecosystem. Keep in mind this is only a theoretical concept and requires further research and development for proper implementation.",
